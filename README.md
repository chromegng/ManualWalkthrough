The Grab n Go (GnG) Loaner project is a fully automated loaner management suite
that manages enterprise enrolled Chrome OS devices by automatically assigning,
returning, and monitoring these devices.

This guide is a complete step-by-step example of implementing Grab N Go with
the sample domain "[optionsareus.com]()" for GnG V0.71.  We will cover every step
taken and methodology for deploying GnG. If any issues with this method arise,  please do
not hesitate to post an issue.


## In order to deploy GnG you must have:

*   An enterprise G Suite domain
*	Chrome OS compatible devices
* 	[Google Keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi/related?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)( or some kind of text editor document)
