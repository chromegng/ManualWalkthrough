## What's the difference between Grab n Go devices and standard Chromebooks?

Grab n Go devices function as standard Chromebooks but have the following
differences:

*   You can only sign in with your Google [domain] account (guest mode can be
    enabled temporarily after you log in).
*   Devices cannot be reset or wiped manually.
*   Developer mode is disabled.
*   You get the Grab n Go Chrome App after you log in (use this to manage your
    loaner).

## How do I enable Guest mode?

After you complete the onboarding instructions in the Grab n Go Chrome App
(available after you log into a GnG device), the option to enable guest mode
appears on the GnG landing page. You can also access GnG any time during your
loan from your loaner Chromebook to enable guest mode.

## How do I return the device?

To return a device:

1.  Open GnG on your loaner device and click Return.
1.  To mark the device as returned, follow the instructions and then log out.
1.  Leave the GnG computer on the shelf where you got it. Be sure to plug it in
    for the next user.

## What data does GnG collect?

To assign and manage devices, GnG collects the usernames of those who sign in to
GnG computers as well as information about the device they signed in on. Devices
are also monitored to determine if they're being used. If a device goes too long
without being used, you'll be reminded to return it. Finally, users are prompted
to answer a survey question during onboarding and offboarding. No other
information is collected by GnG.
