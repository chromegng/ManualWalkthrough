"""A Pure Python replacement for the monotonic library.

`google-cloud-core` depends on `tenacity` which depends on `monotonic`, a native
backport of the Python 3's `time.monotonic` function. Since `monotonic` depends
on ctypes and App Engine's Standard Environment does not support ctypes, a
workaround is necessary to replace its behavior.

Functionally, time.monotonic just provides a timer guaranteed not to tick
backwards (as the term "monotonic" implies). We can duplicate this behavior by
wrapping the normal time.time method with a small bit of logic and state that
ensure the returned tick is greater than or equal to the previous tick.
