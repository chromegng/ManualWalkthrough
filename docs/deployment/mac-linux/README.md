The Grab n Go (GnG) Loaner project is a fully automated loaner management suite
that manages enterprise enrolled Chrome OS devices by automatically assigning,
returning, and monitoring these devices.


## Prequisites

The Prequisites are as follows that need to be completed before beginning the Deployment:
*	[Verify Super Admin Access](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/verifysuperadminaccess)
*	[Create GnG Organizational Units](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/organizationalunits)
*	[Enabling Google Cloud Billing](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/billingaccountid)
*	[OAuth2.0 ID Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/oauthid)
*	[Service Account Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/serviceaccountcreation)
*	[Google Groups Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/googlegroupcreation)
*	[Linux Virtual Machine Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/virtualmachinecreation)
*	[Git Repository Created](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/gitrepositorycreated)
*	Text Document or [Google Keep Notes]() used to record information that will be used in this step


We highly recommend using the virtual machine you created during the prerequisites, so that you may deploy GnG through means of this
virtual Linux Machine, there will be an automation process involved with deploying the web application and will need to have your notes
taken throughout the process handy for input during this process.  This will consists of the the following steps:

*	Deploying the Web Application
*	Deploying the Chrome Application
*	Verifying App Engine is on the latest version




## Deploying the Web Application
* Lets begin by logging into our Linux VM if you have been following the guide. The [Linux Virtual Machine Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/virtualmachinecreation)
will show you how to create and access the Linux VM. Be sure to also have your Google Keep open in another tab
or your text editor handy with the information that has been recorded throughout the Example.

### Web Application has been deployed!
The hardest part is over. Your Grab n Go app has been deployed! In the next steps we will be completing the following:

*	**Bootstrapping** your Grab n Go App(Fancy way of doing a one-time configuration during the intial launch)
*	Uploading code to Github for future development, updates, support, etc.
*	Deploying Your Chrome App
*	Editing Support Page(Optional)
*	Celebrating Completion

Lets continue. Moving forward, i will be moving away from using incgnito mode and a regular Chrome browser. If you were not using chrome, You will have to switch over to complete this deployment. Be wary that you will see me going back to Icognito mode in some future steps but be sure to do this is in a regular chrome browser. You will have less issues if you do it this way.

<br></br>


**29.** You are now ready for the next steps: <br> Press <kbd>Y</kbd> <br> Then Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> <br> Copy the URL the presents itself(DO NOT CLOSE VM) |**30.** Paste URL in a NON-INCOGNITO Chrome Web Broswer

**31.** Lets Go ahead and log in with the super-admin we have been using  |**32.** Once logged in lets go ahead and click the bootstrap button to begin the process. Note-*This could take some time*

**33.** Once completed ypur screen should have all green checks. If it is still processing after 5 minutes then go ahead refresh the page and click the "retry" button. |**34.** *STOP* here and continue on to the next steps before diving into the app. There is just a couple more things to do

## Next Steps
*	Our next steps will be to deploy the GnG Chrome App to the Chrome Webstore.
*	You are reminded to **NOT CLOSE** the Linux VM and it will continue into the
next steps. Follow the prompts and follow the guide
* 	This guide continues into the [Chrome Deployment](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/chrome_deployment)
