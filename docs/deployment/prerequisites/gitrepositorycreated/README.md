The Grab n Go (GnG) Loaner project is a fully automated loaner management suite
that manages enterprise enrolled Chrome OS devices by automatically assigning,
returning, and monitoring these devices.


## Prequisites

The Prequisites are as follows that need to either be verified or installed and
further instructions can be found by clicking each link:


*	[Verify Super Admin Access](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/verifysuperadminaccess)
*	[Create GnG Organizational Units](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/organizationalunits)
*	[Enable Google Cloud Billingcd .cd ](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/billingaccountid)
*	[OAuth2.0 ID Creation](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/oauthid)
*	[Service Account Creation](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/serviceaccountcreation)
*	[Google Groups Creation](https://github.com/kid-yume/gnglinuxdeployment/tree/dev/docs/deployment/prerequisites/googlegroupcreation)
*	[Linux Virtual Machine Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/virtualmachinecreation)


### Creating Github Repository
*	In this portion of the example. We will be creating a github repository for our "optionsareus.com" domain. This 
is a crucial part of having your own grabngo instance because it allows you the freedom to customize your instance from 
any device, other then the Linux Virtual Machine in which you will deploy GnG from. As a plus; It also provides as a nifty
backup solution! 
*	I will be using the superadmin email as the account owner in this example. Although it is unnecessary, and recommended
that you use a different email and account to sign-up for the website. 
*	If you already have an account with Github. We reccommend that you use that account and skip to [Step 10]()
for the repository URL creation.
*	Now Lets begin by opening a new chrome web browser. Although, any web browser is compatible; using chrome is the recommened use. 
Follow the below steps(click on the picture for a larger image):



**1.**	Go [Github's Home Page](https://github.com/) You should be instantly asked to create an account. If not click **Sign UP** in right-hand corner     |**2.**  Fill out the requested information. I will be using the super-admin email for the email. Its recommended that you use something else

### Completed Repository Creation
*	The repository has been made and will be needed during the deployment process. Make sure you recorded the necessary information and you may go ahead and dismiss this window for now and move on to the next steps.
