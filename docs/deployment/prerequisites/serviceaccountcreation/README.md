The Grab n Go (GnG) Loaner project is a fully automated loaner management suite
that manages enterprise enrolled Chrome OS devices by automatically assigning,
returning, and monitoring these devices.


## Prequisites

The Prequisites are as follows that need to be completed before doing this step: 
*	[Verify Super Admin Access](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/verifysuperadminaccess)
*	[Create GnG Organizational Units](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/organizationalunits)
*	[OAuth2.0 ID Creation](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/oauthid)
*	[Enable Google Cloud Billing ](https://github.com/chromegng/ManualWalkthrough/tree/master/docs/deployment/prerequisites/billingaccountid)

We will go through how to do each of the above following throughout this guide. If you find yourself having difficulties a
[YouTube](google.com) video has been uploaded showing how to properly go through each of these items.
